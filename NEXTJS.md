# NextJS

[Documentation](https://nextjs.org/)

## What is NextJS?

-   The react framework for production
-   Used to build large scale react applications production ready
-   A full stack react framework
-   Solves common problems and makes building React apps easier!
-   Doesn't require as many third party libraries to make an app
-   You still write react code, components, props, state, context etc...
-   lots of built-in features (e.g. routing) that help you solve common problems & clear guidance on how to use those features

## Server Side Rendering

-   prepares the content on the page on the server instead of the client
-   helps search engine crawlers find content on your page to send to searchers
    -   on client side rendering search engine crawlers only see the html skeleton
-   better user experience because there is no flicker
-   automatic page pre-rendering
    -   great for SEO and inital load
-   blends client-side and server-side
    -   fetch data on the server and render finished pages

## KEY FEATURES

-   file-based routing
    -   define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code
    -   less code, less work, highly understandable
    -   lets you go back to a more basic html type routing
    -   supports dynamic routes, slugs etc...
-   fullstack framework
    -   easily add backend server-side code to your next/react apps
    -   stores data, getting data, authentication etc. can be added to your react projects
-   nextjs allows you to decide when to allow server side rendering

## Routing

How File-based Routing Works...

-   /pages

    -   index.js
        -   main starting page "/"
    -   about.js
        -   about page "/about"
    -   /products
        -   index.js
            -   all products page "/products"
        -   [id].js
            -   dynamic route for product detail page "/products/${id}"
        -   [...slug].js
            -   dynamic route for slug parameters

-   index.js files are used as the base file for the folder route

-   nextjs gives a special hook and HOC to give access to routing in a component
    -   useRouter from 'next/router'
        -   for functional components
    -   withRouter from 'next/router'
        -   HOC for class based components

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const PortfolioProjectPage = () => {
    const router = useRouter();

    // query property gives access to complete data in the url
    // can be used to send a req to a backend server
    // to fetch the piece of data with an id of router.query.projectid
    console.log(router.query);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>The Portfolio Project Page</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default PortfolioProjectPage;
```

## Slug files

```javascript
// filename [...slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const BlogPostsPage = () => {
    const router = useRouter();

    // returns an array of the slug parameter
    // {slug: ['2019', '12']}
    console.log(router.query);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>The Blog Posts</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default BlogPostsPage;
```

## Links

Next has a native Link import from 'next/Link' to navigate within the app, just as with React 'a' tags are only used to navigate away from the application.

```javascript
import Link from 'next/Link';

const HomePage = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>The Home Page</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <Link href="/portfolio">Portfolio</Link>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
};

export default HomePage;
```
